# LINEAR REGRESSION

Linear Regression is a statistical model that attempts to show the relationship between two variables using a Linear Equation.

### What is Regression?

Regression analysis is a form of predictive modeling technique that investigates the relationship between a dependent and independent variable.

So, in linear regression, we establish a relationship between the independent and dependent variables by fitting the best line. This best fit line is known as the regression line and represented by a linear equation.

**y = mx + C**
